Most of the Ignite content will be available [on demand](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home) for those who can’t attend the live event.

### **Copilot momentum**

Microsoft 365 Copilot is your AI assistant for work, and we have seen the momentum grow as more organizations are moving to Copilot and deploying it to great success. All up, [nearly 70%](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/events/fy-2025/earnings-fy-2025-q1) of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.

That echoes an industry trend: A [recent IDC study](https://aka.ms/ai-study) showed that generative AI is on the rise, with 75% adoption among companies surveyed in 2024. In addition, for every $1 invested, companies are realizing a return of $3.70, and leaders are saying they are realizing as much as a $10 return, according to the study.

The investments that Microsoft has made in Copilot are paying dividends for our customers.

We recently highlighted some of the [more than 200 customer stories](https://aka.ms/AIcustomersBlog) of accelerated AI Transformation, with Copilot helping many of them spark innovation and transform their organization for the better. Several examples include:

- Intelligent power management company **Eaton** leveraged Microsoft 365 Copilot to help streamline and automate operations, improve data access, centralize knowledge and empower teams to focus on higher-value tasks. One immediate challenge addressed through Copilot focused on the manual, time-consuming documentation process in Eaton’s Finance operations. Copilot helped Eaton document over 9,000 standard operating procedures (SOPs), resulting in **an 83% time savings for each SOP**.
- Consulting firm **McKinsey &amp; Company** is creating an agent to speed up the client onboarding process. The **pilot showed lead time could be reduced by 90% and administrative work reduced by 30%**. The agent automates complex processes, such as identifying the right expert capabilities and staffing teams and acts as a single place where colleagues can ask questions and request follow-ups. By streamlining tasks and reducing manual inputs, this agent could potentially save consultants many hours, allowing them to spend more time with clients.

### **Boosting productivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot**

Microsoft is continuing to supercharge productivity with new capabilities in Microsoft 365 Copilot designed to help simplify the workday.

**Copilot Actions**, now in private preview, enable anyone to automate everyday tasks with simple, fill-in-the-blank prompts, whether it’s getting a daily summary of meeting actions in Microsoft Teams, compiling weekly reports or getting an email upon return from vacation that summarizes missed meetings, chats and emails.

Anyone can easily set up Actions right in their Microsoft 365 app, allowing users to focus on more impactful work, save time and boost productivity.

New agents in Microsoft 365 are designed to help scale individual impact and transform business process. At Ignite we will introduce:

- **Agents in SharePoint:** These natural language AI assistants are grounded on relevant SharePoint sites, files and folders to make it easy to find answers from that content, and to make quicker decisions as a result. Now generally available, every SharePoint site will include an agent tailored to its content. Users can also create customized agents scoped to select SharePoint files, folders or sites with as little as one click.
- **Interpreter:** This agent in Teams helps users overcome language barriers by enabling real-time, speech-to-speech interpretation in meetings. Available in public preview in early 2025, meeting participants will also have the option to have the agent simulate their personal voice.
- The **Employee Self-Service Agent:** An agent available in private preview in Business Chat expedites answers for the most common policy-related questions and simplifies action-taking on key HR and IT-related tasks — like helping employees understand their benefits or request a new laptop. It can be customized in Copilot Studio to meet an organization’s unique needs.
- Other agents in public preview take real-time **meeting notes** in Teams and automate **project management** from start to finish in Planner.

### **Copilot + AI Stack**

The Copilot stack empowers users to build more ambitious products by leveraging advanced technology at each layer of the stack. To create a unified experience where customers can design, customize and manage AI applications and agents, we are introducing **Azure AI Foundry**, which gives customers access to all existing Azure AI services and tooling, plus new capabilities like:

It is in preview now and will become generally available for purchase starting in April 2025 in select markets with an MSRP of $349, allowing users to work securely in a familiar Windows desktop in the Microsoft Cloud with responsive, high-fidelity experiences.

Windows 365 Link is secure by design. The device has no local data, no local apps and admin-less users so corporate data stays protected within the Microsoft Cloud.

Other new capabilities for Copilot+ PCs for commercial customers include harnessing the power of inbuilt native processing units (NPUs) to deliver local AI. With improved Windows Search, and the new Recall experience (preview), finding what you need on your PC is easier than ever by just describing what you are looking for. These features are releasing first to our Windows Insider community on Copilot+ PCs before rolling out more broadly to our customers.

### **BlackRock momentum**

Four years ago, [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual), one of the world’s pre-eminent asset management firms, formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft to move its Aladdin platform to Microsoft Azure. With this foundation on Azure, BlackRock rolled out generative AI tools for global clients with Aladdin Copilot. Through generative AI, Aladdin Copilot serves to strengthen the connective tissue across the platform, leveraging Microsoft technology to help users receive answers instantly to unlock new efficiencies and discover important business insights even faster. Aladdin Copilot makes BlackRock’s Aladdin platform even more intelligent and responsive. That results in enhanced productivity, enables scale and keeps users more informed.

BlackRock’s move to Azure and launch of Aladdin Copilot are just two of the many ongoing milestones in a long-term partnership that also includes an enterprise-wide deal for 24,000 seats of Microsoft 365 Copilot. Today, about 60% of BlackRock’s Copilot user population is leveraging Copilot on a weekly basis. Additionally, BlackRock also recently made the choice to move its on-prem CRM solution to the cloud with Dynamics 365, citing its native integration with Teams and Outlook as one of its primary decision-making factors.

### **Strength in security**

We know that the threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and it’s imperative that we stay ahead of bad actors. At Microsoft we believe that security is a team sport, and we are stronger when we partner as a security community to share information, collaborate and stop bad actors.

In that spirit, and as part of our Secure Future Initiative (SFI), at Ignite [we are announcing](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/securing-ai-and-cloud-with-the-zero-day-quest) the largest public security research event in history: the Zero Day Quest. This event, which focuses on AI and cloud security, will offer the largest award pool in the industry at $4 million, in addition to our existing $16 million annual bounty program. This competition aims to attract the world’s best security minds to tackle high-impact scenarios critical to our customers’ security, with award multipliers, starting today.

As the threat landscape has changed, we have seen rapid evolution in the way attackers exploit weaknesses within systems — particularly by navigating graph relationships between identities, files and devices to uncover attack paths. Attackers thinking in graphs cause wider damage from the first point of intrusion. Traditional security products, with limited visibility into these graph relationships, are often better suited to protect specific devices or mediums — like laptops or inboxes — rather than the full scope of potential attack surface.

Today’s [**Microsoft Security** **Exposure Management**](https://aka.ms/Ignite2024Security) launch is a pivotal step in transforming cybersecurity with savvy data and AI-based strategies. The power of incorporating Microsoft graph data, in context with data from customers’ other third-party security tools, creates a powerful single pane of glass to visualize attack paths before threat actors do. With computing power and cloud-scale performance to distill powerful real-time mapping of assets and evolving risks, Exposure Management assists security teams in preventing intrusions and provides IT, operations and risk leaders with real-time data to support cyber risk decision-making.

This is only a small section of the many exciting features and updates we will be announcing [at Ignite](https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home). As a reminder, you can view keynote sessions from Microsoft executives including Satya Nadella, Rajesh Jha, Scott Guthrie, Charlie Bell and Vasu Jakkal, live or on-demand.

Plus, you can get more on all these announcements by exploring the [Book of News](http://aka.ms/book-of-news), the official compendium of all today’s news.

## From questions to discoveries: NASA’s new Earth Copilot brings Microsoft AI capabilities to democratize access to complex data
Published: Thu, 14 Nov 2024 16:00:00 +0000

Every day, [NASA’s satellites orbit Earth](https://science.nasa.gov/earth), capturing a wealth of information that helps us understand our planet. From monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change, this vast trove of Earth Science data has the potential to drive scientific discoveries, inform policy decisions and support industries like agriculture, urban planning and disaster response.

But navigating the over 100 petabytes of collected data can be challenging, which is why NASA has collaborated with Microsoft to explore the use of a custom copilot using Azure OpenAI Service to develop NASA’s Earth Copilot, which could transform how people interact with Earth’s data.

Geospatial data is complex, and often requires some level of technical expertise to navigate it. As a result, this data tends to be accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists. As NASA collects more data from new satellites, these complexities only grow and may further limit the potential pool of people able to draw insights and develop applications that could benefit society.

Recognizing this challenge, NASA embarked on a mission to make its data more accessible and user-friendly. Through NASA’s Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, the agency seeks to democratize data access, breaking down technical barriers to empower a diverse range of audiences, from scientists and educators to policymakers and the general public.

### **The challenge: Navigating the complexity of data**

NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Program is responsible for collecting an incredible variety of data from spaceborne sensors and instruments. This data spans everything from atmospheric conditions to land cover changes, ocean temperatures and more. However, the sheer scale and complexity of this information can be overwhelming. For many, finding and extracting insights requires navigating technical interfaces, understanding data formats and mastering the intricacies of geospatial analysis — specialized skills that very few non-technical users possess. AI could streamline this process, reducing time to gain insights from Earth’s data to a matter of seconds.

This issue isn’t just a matter of convenience; it has real-world implications. For example, scientists who need to analyze historical data on hurricanes to improve predictive models, or policymakers who want to study deforestation patterns to implement environmental regulations, may find themselves unable to easily access the data they need. This inaccessibility affects a broad array of sectors, including agriculture, urban planning and disaster response, where timely insights from spaceborne data could make a significant difference.

Moreover, as new satellites with new instruments continue to launch and collect more data, NASA is constantly faced with the challenge of building new tools to manage and make sense of this growing repository. The agency explored emerging technologies that could not only streamline data discovery but also broaden accessibility, enabling more people to engage with the data and uncover new insights.

### **The solution: AI-powered data access through Microsoft Azure**

To address these challenges, NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to develop an AI-driven customer copilot, called Earth Copilot, which could simplify data access and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data. Together, they built the proof of concept AI model that leverages Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and advanced AI capabilities to transform how users can search, discover and analyze NASA’s geospatial data.

The key to NASA’s Earth Copilot lies in the integration of cloud-based technologies like Azure OpenAI Service, which provides access to powerful AI models and natural language processing capabilities that enable developers to integrate intelligent, conversational AI into their applications. This approach allows NASA to integrate AI into its existing data analysis platform — VEDA. These technologies together make it easier for users to search, discover and analyze Earth Science data

By combining these technologies, Earth Copilot enables users to interact with NASA’s data repository through plain language queries. Instead, they can simply ask questions such as “What was the impact of Hurricane Ian in Sanibel Island?” or “How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect air quality in the US?” AI will then retrieve relevant datasets, making the process seamless and intuitive.

Our goal was to create a seamless, scalable solution that could evolve as NASA’s data, tools and applications grow.”***

### **Democratizing data for open science**

The collaboration between NASA IMPACT and Microsoft has resulted in a solution that democratizes access to spaceborne data, enabling a broader range of users to engage with NASA’s science data. This has significant benefits for the scientific community, as researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. For example, climate scientists can quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.

Educators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, fostering curiosity and encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers. Policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development and disaster preparedness, ensuring they have the most accurate information at their fingertips.

> ***“The vision behind this collaboration was to leverage AI and cloud technologies to bring Earth’s insights to communities that have been underserved, where access to data can lead to tangible improvements,” said Minh Nguyen, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. “By enabling users to interact with the data through simple, plain language queries, we’re helping to democratize access to spaceborne information.”***

The development of this AI prototype aligns with NASA’s Open Science initiative, which aims to make scientific research more transparent, inclusive and collaborative. By removing barriers to data discovery, NASA and Microsoft are setting the stage for a new era of discovery, where insights are not confined to a select few but can be explored and expanded by anyone curious about the world.

### **Looking ahead: Bridging the gap between data and insights**

At the moment, the NASA Earth Copilot is available to NASA scientists and researchers to explore and test its capabilities. Any responsible deployment of AI technologies requires rigorous assessments to ensure the data and outputs cannot be misused. After a period of internal evaluations and testing, the NASA IMPACT team will explore the integration of this capability into the [VEDA platform](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard).

This collaboration exemplifies how technology can empower people, drive innovation and create positive change. Solutions like this will be essential in ensuring the benefits of data are shared widely, enabling more people to engage with, analyze and act upon information that shapes our world.

As today’s platform shift to AI continues to gain momentum, Microsoft is working to understand just how organizations can drive lasting business value. We recently commissioned a study with IDC, [**The Business Opportunity of AI**](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html), to uncover new insights around business value and help guide organizations on their journey of AI transformation. [The study found](https://aka.ms/ai-study) that for every $1 organizations invest in generative AI, they’re realizing an average of $3.70 in return — and uncovered insights about the future potential of AI to reshape business processes and drive change across industries.

Today, [more than 85% of the Fortune 500](https://aka.ms/AIinAction) are using Microsoft AI solutions to shape their future. In working with organizations large and small, across every industry and geography, we’ve seen that most transformation initiatives are designed to achieve one of four business outcomes:

1. **Enriching employee experiences:** Using AI to streamline or automate repetitive, mundane tasks can allow your employees to dive into more complex, creative and ultimately more valuable work.
2. **Reinventing customer engagement:** AI can create more personalized, tailored customer experiences, delighting your target audiences while lightening the load for employees.
3. **Reshaping business processes:** Virtually any business process can be reimagined with AI, from marketing to supply chain operations to finance, and AI is even allowing organizations to go beyond process optimization and discover exciting new growth opportunities.
4. **Bending the curve on innovation:** AI is revolutionizing innovation by speeding up creative processes and product development, reducing the time to market and allowing companies to differentiate in an often crowded field.

In this blog, we’ve collected more than 200 of our favorite real-life examples of how organizations are embracing Microsoft’s proven AI capabilities to drive impact and shape today’s platform shift to AI. **Today, we’ve added new stories of customers using our AI capabilities at the beginning of each section. We’ll regularly update this story with more.** We hope you find an example or two that can inspire your own transformation journey.

### **IDC’s 2024 top 5 trends for AI**

IDC’s findings align with what Microsoft is seeing as we work with companies across industries to deploy AI. We’ve highlighted [more than 200 of our top AI customer stories](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/12/how-real-world-businesses-are-transforming-with-ai/) to show a sampling of how AI is already driving impact today. Below is a look at the top trends we’re seeing in IDC’s study and the impact of those trends on organizations working with AI today.

**#1 Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.** Employee productivity is the No. 1 business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are using AI for productivity, and 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. While productivity is a top goal, generative AI use cases that are close behind include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management and product or service innovation — and nearly half of the companies surveyed expect AI to have a high degree of impact across all those areas over the next 24 months.

> **Customer snapshot:**
>
> *At the global marketing and advertising agency dentsu, employees are already saving 15 to 30 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries.*
>
> ***“Copilot has transformed the way we deliver creative concepts to our clients, enabling real-time collaboration. Agility, security and uniqueness are crucial, but our goal is to lead this transformation company-wide, from top to bottom.”***
>
> *— Takuya Kodama, Business Strategy Manager at dentsu*

**#2 Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.** In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This shows a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies realize the value of out-of-the-box use cases and expand to more advanced scenarios.

> **Customer snapshot:**
>
> *Siemens has developed the Siemens Industrial Copilot, which has eased the challenges caused by increasing complexity and labor shortages for dozens of customers in different industries.*
>
> ***“In full appreciation of GenAI’s transformational potential, it’s important to remember that production does not have an ‘undo’ button. It takes diligence and effort to mature AI to industrial-grade quality. The Siemens Industrial Copilot for Engineering significantly eases our customers’ workload and addresses the pressing challenges of skill shortages and increasing complexity in industrial automation. This AI-powered solution is a game-changer for our industry with over 50 customers already using it to boost efficiency and tackle labor shortages.”***
>
> *— Boris Scharinger, AI Strategist at Siemens Digital Industries*

**#3 Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.** Even though it is relatively new to the market, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding — 75% of respondents report current usage up from 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media &amp; Telco, Mobility, Retail &amp; Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education. Overall, generative AI is generating higher ROI across industries.

> **Customer snapshot:**
>
> *Providence has leveraged AI to extend and enhance patient care, streamline processes and workflows and improve the effectiveness of caregivers.*
>
> ***“Whether we’re partnering with organizations on the leading edge of this technology — like Microsoft — and building bespoke solutions through Azure OpenAI Service, advancing clinical research to help cancer patients receive personalized and precise treatments faster, or ‘hitting the easy button’ and adopting established technologies like Microsoft 365 Copilot or DAX Copilot, we have successfully stayed on the forefront of this tech revolution. For example, physicians who use DAX Copilot save an average of 5.33 minutes per visit, and 80% of physicians have reported lower cognitive burden after using DAX Copilot.”***
>
> *— Sarah Vaezy, EVP, Chief Strategy and Digital Officer at Providence*

**#4 AI leaders are seeing greater returns and accelerated innovation.** While companies using generative AI are averaging $3.7x ROI, the top leaders using generative AI are realizing significantly higher returns, with an average ROI of $10.3. In addition to the enhanced business value, leaders are also on an accelerated path to build and implement new solutions — 29% of leaders implement AI in less than 3 months versus 6% of companies in the laggard category.

> **Customer snapshot:**
>
> *Södra is an international forest industry group that processes forest products from 52,000 owners into renewable, climate-smart products for international market. Every day Södra collects and interprets climate impact data to make thousands of decisions for every part of the value chain.*
>
> ***“With innovative AI technology from Microsoft, our business experts and data scientists have been able to help make us more sustainable while also improving revenue significantly.”***
>
> *— Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra*

**#5 Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge**. Thirty percent of respondents indicated a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26 percent say they lack employees with the skills needed to learn and work with AI. This dovetails with findings from the [**Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report**](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/ai-at-work-is-here-now-comes-the-hard-part___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6OTVmMzpmYWVjMDJkZmE4ODNlNDYwNDZlN2UzY2ZlNDY3NDQ3YjJjNTIxODgwYTk1YTljNjQ4ZDE0YTgzNDE1MzRkMjlhOnA6VDpG), which found that 55 percent of business leaders are concerned about having enough skilled talent to fill roles.

That is why over the past year we have helped train and certify over 23 million people in more than 200 countries in digital skills. And we are committed to working in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry and civil society to help millions more learn to use AI.

> **Customer snapshot:**
>
> *The University of South Florida (USF) is partnering with Microsoft to streamline processes and enhance innovation for all aspects of university operations with AI.*
>
> ***“We’re giving students a leg up to do amazing things with AI as part of tomorrow’s workforce. Our focus on generative AI not only drives operational efficiency but also empowers our community to unlock new levels of creativity and impact, further positioning USF as a leader in AI adoption, which includes being among the first universities in the nation to form a college dedicated to AI, cybersecurity and computing.”***

### **AI’s growing economic impact**

While companies today are largely implementing out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and seeing significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry and line-of-business applications in the next 24 months — demonstrating that today’s ROI is quickly becoming tomorrow’s competitive edge.

“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development and are beginning an evolution from using just off-the-shelf assistants and copilots that support knowledge discovery and content generation to custom AI agents to execute complex, multistep workflows across a digital world,” says Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “With responsible technology usage and workplace transformation, IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030 and drive 3.5% of global GDP in 2030.”

Key findings from [IDC’s The Business Opportunity](https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-business-opportunity-of-ai.html___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjAxZWUwM2NlMzljZjdjMTA0YjIwYWViMmQ1MGYxYmU0OjY6YzEzMzo1Y2E2ZTI1ZTgyNzNiMjQ0ZDhjOTJhMmRjNjA1YzRhNWIwNGU4MjcwZmRjNDc0YjBmZjFkNDhmZDg4MDNjM2YwOnA6VDpG) of AI study include:

- Generative AI usage jumped from 55% in 2023 to 75% in 2024.
- For every $1 a company invests in generative AI, the ROI is $3.7x.
- The top leaders using generative AI are realizing an ROI of $10.3.
- On average, AI deployments are taking less than 8 months and organizations are realizing value within 13 months.
- Within 24 months, most organizations plan to expand beyond pre-built AI solutions to advanced AI workloads that are customized or custom-built.
- The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media &amp; Telco, Mobility, Retail &amp; Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare and Education.
- 43% say productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI.
- The primary way that organizations are monetizing AI today is through productivity use cases. In the next 24 months, a greater focus will be placed on functional and industry use cases.
- The top barrier when implementing AI is the lack of both technical and day-to-day AI skills.

### **Learn how to fuel your AI journey**

IDC’s study, which included more than 4,000 business leaders and AI decision-makers around the world, also identifies the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI. As businesses integrate new solutions, they navigate important considerations such as data privacy, responsible use and the need for investment in both technology and skills.

When I look to the next phase of Microsoft, both in terms of our scale and our massive opportunity ahead, it’s clear that we need to continue adding exceptional talent at every level of the organization to increase our depth and capability across our business priorities – spanning security, quality, and AI innovation.

[![A photo of Jay Parikh, a member of the senior leadership team.](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/10/Jay_Parikh_bw_Final-300x275.jpg)](https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/2024/10/Jay_Parikh_bw_Final.jpg)

Jay Parikh

With that context, I’m excited to share that Jay Parikh is joining Microsoft as a member of the senior leadership team (SLT), reporting to me. Jay was the global head of engineering at Facebook (now Meta) and most recently was CEO of Lacework. He has an impressive track record, with a unique combination of experiences building and scaling technical teams that serve both commercial customers and consumers. His deep connections across the start-up and VC ecosystems, coupled with his leadership roles at Akamai and Ning, will bring valuable perspective to Microsoft.

Over the years I’ve known Jay, I’ve admired him as a technology leader and respected engineer with a deep commitment to driving innovation and striving for operational excellence. His focus extends beyond technology, with his passion for and dedication to developing people, fostering a strong culture, and building world-class talent, all in service of delivering faster value to customers and driving business growth. In fact, there are very few leaders in our industry with Jay’s experience in leading teams through the rapid growth and scale required to support today’s largest internet businesses.

As he onboards, Jay will immerse himself in learning about our company priorities and our culture and will spend time connecting with our senior leaders and meeting with customers, partners, and employees around the world. We will share more on his role and focus in the next few months.

Please join me in welcoming Jay to Microsoft.

## Microsoft’s 2024 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report: Our most global, transparent report yet
Published: Wed, 23 Oct 2024 15:00:01 +0000

Today, I am sharing Microsoft’s [2024 Diversity &amp; Inclusion Report](https://aka.ms/DIReport), our most global and transparent report to date. This marks our sixth consecutive annual report and the eleventh year sharing our global workforce data, highlighting our progress and areas of opportunity.

Our ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion is directly tied to our inherently inclusive mission — to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, enabling us to innovate in the era of AI. As we approach our company’s 50th anniversary, we remain deeply committed to D&amp;I because it is what creates transformational solutions to the most complex challenges for customers, partners and the world.

### **Key data**

We gather a range of data, which is presented in specific ways throughout the report. In the following section, it is important to understand the distinction between our \***Broader Microsoft business** and our \*\***Core Microsoft business**.

**New and expanded data**

- Datacenters: As we lead the AI platform shift, our workforce continues to expand to include employees with varied backgrounds and roles, and we are [sharing new data](https://aka.ms/2024DIReport-DataCenters) this year on a growing employee population in datacenter roles. The population of datacenter employees grew 23.9% globally and 28.9% in the US in 2024, more than tripling since 2020.
- In our most global report to date, we expanded [new global Self-ID data](https://aka.ms/2024DIReport-SelfID) to include Indigenous and military employees, as well as those with disabilities. For example, 5.7% of global employees in our core Microsoft business self-identified as having a disability, an increase of 0.2 percentage points year over year.
- We continue to have pay equity. For median unadjusted pay analysis, the data shows we have made progress in narrowing the gaps. This year [we expanded](https://aka.ms/2024DIReport-PayEquity) pay equity analysis and median unadjusted pay analysis to not only include women inside and outside the US, but also include a combined view of women globally. Increasing representation for women and racial and ethnic minority groups at more senior levels, combined with maintaining pay equity for all, will continue to reduce the median unadjusted pay gap.

**Representation**

- [Representation of women](https://aka.ms/2024DIReport-Representation) in our core Microsoft workforce is 31.6%, an increase of 0.4 percentage points year over year. Additionally, the representation of women in technical roles is 27.2%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points year over year.
- Representation of women in our core Microsoft workforce rose year over year at all leadership levels except Executive.
- Leadership representation in our core Microsoft workforce of Black and African American employees at the Partner + Executive level grew to 4.3%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points year over year. Leadership representation in our core Microsoft workforce of Hispanic and Latinx employees at the Executive level rose to 4.6%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points year over year.
- In our broader Microsoft workforce, representation of racial and ethnic minority groups is 53.9%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points year over year.

### **Culture and inclusion in focus**

**Employee sentiment and engagement**

- Our semi-annual [Employee Signals](http://aka.ms/2024DIReport-Signals) survey focuses on employee experience and helps us deepen our understanding so we can adjust our efforts where needed. These insights show that employees continue to feel like they are thriving, with a global and US score of 76. Within Employee Signals, we focus on thriving, which we define as “being energized and empowered to do meaningful work.” This is designed to measure employees’ sense of purpose, which is important to personal and professional fulfillment. We survey employees on three dimensions of thriving: Feeling energized, feeling empowered and doing meaningful work.
- Our Daily Signals survey results indicate employee perceptions around Microsoft’s commitment to creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace increased two points year over year to an average score of 79.
- Since introducing the concept of allyship to employees in 2018, we have inspired and led a positive impact on our culture. As of June 2024, 95.6% of employees reported some level of awareness of the concept of allyship, up from 65.0% in 2019 when we first started asking employees about their awareness.

### **A commitment that spans decades**

Our annual D&amp;I report not only reviews our data, but also illuminates the intentional strategy and actions that have helped us make progress across [our company’s journey](https://aka.ms/2024DIReport-Timeline).

Examples include:

- Being one of the first Fortune 500 companies to expand antidiscrimination policy and benefits to LGBTQIA+ employees in 1989.
- Announcing our [Racial Equity Initiative](https://aka.ms/racial-equity-initiative) in June 2020, outlining actions and progress we expect to make by 2025 to help address racial injustice and inequity in the US for Black and African American communities.
- Launching immersive D&amp;I learning simulations in 2021, allowing employees to practice crucial D&amp;I skills, such as recognizing and addressing bias, responding to microaggressions and demonstrating effective allyship.
- Building on more than a decade of helping to reskill military service members through our Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), and this year [expanding this skilling opportunity](http://aka.ms/milspouse) to train military spouses for portable, in-demand IT roles.
- Introducing [pronouns and self-expression features](https://aka.ms/M365PronounsLI) in Microsoft 365, an innovation brought directly to fruition because we listened to, and collaborated with, customers, partners and employees who asked for these features.

### **A mission as bold as ours**

At Microsoft, we’re guided by our mission, worldview and culture. Our mission is the why; it drives our actions. Our worldview is the what, shaping our strategy and products. Culture is the how, influencing everything with a focus on growth and innovation. Culture is also the who: Who makes up the workforce, who services our customers, who innovates the future of tech. The diversity of the workforce, combined with inclusion, unlocks individual and collective potential. This is what is necessary to stay relevant, compete at scale and win.

Every person. Every organization. Every day. Everywhere.

Here’s to making progress for the next 50 years.

## New autonomous agents scale your team like never before
Published: Mon, 21 Oct 2024 09:29:41 +0000

Already, 60 percent of the Fortune 500 are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to accelerate business results and empower their teams. With Copilot supporting sales associates, Lumen Technologies projects $50 million dollars in savings annually. Honeywell(1) equates productivity gains to adding 187 full-time employees and Finastra is reducing creative production time from seven months to seven weeks.

Today, we’re announcing new agentic capabilities that will accelerate these gains and bring AI-first business process to every organization.

- First, the ability to **create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio** will be in public preview next month.

<!--THE END-->

- Second, we’re introducing **ten new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365** to build capacity for every sales, service, finance and supply chain team.

Copilot is *your* AI assistant — it works for you — and Copilot Studio enables you to easily create, manage and connect agents to Copilot. Think of **agents as the new apps for an AI-powered world**. Every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous. They will work on behalf of an individual, team or function to execute and orchestrate businesses process. Copilot is how you’ll interact with these agents, and they’ll do everything from accelerating lead generation and processing sales orders to automating your supply chain.

**Empowering more customers to build autonomous agents in Copilot Studio**

Earlier this year, we announced a host of powerful new capabilities in Copilot Studio, including the ability to create autonomous agents. [Next month](https://aka.ms/CopilotStudioBlog10-21), these capabilities are shifting from private to public preview, allowing more customers to reimagine critical business processes with AI. Agents draw on the context of your work data in Microsoft 365 Graph, systems of record, Dataverse and Fabric, and can support everything from your IT help desk to employee onboarding and act as a personal concierge for sales and service.

Organizations like **Clifford Chance, McKinsey &amp; Company, Pets at Home and Thomson Reuters** are already creating autonomous agents to increase revenue, reduce costs and scale impact. [**Pets at Home**](https://aka.ms/AAsdpp3), the U.K.’s leading pet care business, created an agent for its profit protection team to more efficiently compile cases for skilled human review, which could have the potential to drive a seven-figure annual savings. **McKinsey &amp; Company** is creating an agent that will speed up the client onboarding process. The pilot showed lead time could be reduced by 90% and administrative work reduced by 30%. **Thomson Reuters** built a professional-grade agent to speed up the legal due diligence workflow, with initial testing showing some tasks could be done in half the time. This agent can help Thomson Reuters increase the efficiency of work for clients and boost its new business pipeline.

**Scaling your teams with 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365**

New autonomous agents enable customers to move from legacy lines of business applications to AI-first business process. AI is today’s ROI and tomorrow’s competitive edge. These new agents are designed to help every sales, service, finance and supply chain team drive business value — and are just the start. We will create many more agents in the coming year that will give customers the competitive advantage they need to future-proof their organization. Today, we’re introducing ten of these autonomous agents. Here are a few examples:

- **Sales Qualification Agent:** In a profession where time literally equals money, this agent enables sellers to focus their time on the highest priority sales opportunities while the agent researches leads, helps prioritize opportunities and guides customer outreach with personalized emails and responses.

<!--THE END-->

- **Supplier Communications Agent:** This agent enables customers to optimize their supply chain and minimize costly disruptions by autonomously tracking supplier performance, detecting delays and responding accordingly — freeing procurement teams from time consuming manual monitoring and firefighting.

<!--THE END-->

- **Customer Intent** and **Customer Knowledge Management** **Agents:** A business gets one chance to make a first impression, and these two agents are game changers for customer care teams facing high call volumes, talent shortages and heightened customer expectations. These agents work hand in hand with a customer service representative by learning how to resolve customer issues and autonomously adding knowledge-based articles to scale best practices across the care team.

As agents become more prevalent in the enterprise, customers want to be confident that they have robust data governance and security. The agents coming to Dynamics 365 follow our core security, privacy and responsible AI commitments. Agents built in Copilot Studio [include guardrails and controls](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/blog/power-apps/it-governance-controls-for-your-copilot-agents/?msockid=09cbdd77556e64e60465cefe54d465ae) established by maker-defined instructions, knowledge and actions. The data sources linked to the agent adhere to stringent security measures and controls — all managed in Copilot Studio. These include data loss prevention, robust authentication protocols and more. Once these agents are created, IT administrators can apply a comprehensive set of features to govern their use.

**Microsoft’s own transformation**

At Microsoft, [we’re using Copilot and agents](https://aka.ms/MSCopilotBusinessValue) to reimagine business process across every function while empowering employees to scale their impact. Using Copilot, one sales team has achieved 9.4% higher revenue per seller and closed 20% more deals(2). And thanks to Copilot, one team is resolving customer cases nearly 12% faster(3). Our Marketing team is seeing a 21.5% increase in conversion rate on Azure.com with a custom agent designed to assist buyers(4). And in Human Resources, our employee self-service agent is helping answer questions with 42% greater accuracy(5). 

With Copilot and agents, the possibilities are endless — we can’t wait to see what you create. [Start building](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio) agents in Copilot Studio today.
